All of my Recommendation systems projects are in this repository.

Hope you will like it.

1. Groceries dataset :-

In this, I have done some analysis on groceries dataset and found out some customers behaviour which will help us furthur in buisness decision.

' Groceries_dataset.csv ' is the dataset file.

' Groceries dataset Sol..ipynb ' is a jupyter solution file.

You can fine the dataset on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/heeraldedhia/groceries-dataset

2. Book Recoomendation System :-

It is a recommendation system model, which helps us to recommend the books which are more interesting on the basis of Pearson's correlation.

If you want an overview of Pearson's correlation, check out my article - https://yashguptacorrelations.blogspot.com/2021/05/pearsons-correlation.html

The dataset contains 3 CSV files for USER, RATINGS and BOOKS.
